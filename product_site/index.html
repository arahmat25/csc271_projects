<h1> <strong> Foreign Finds </strong> </h1>
<p> <em> Foreign Finds </em>is the product website I am creating. The purpose of this website is to allow 
    users to find foreign and exotic foods and fruits. Business and vendor owners will be able to 
    post their business on this website and users will be able to find these foods. People will invest in this
    product because there are many foreign foods and fruits that are hard to find. This will the draw the attention 
    of people who have a craving for these types of foods.
